His research focuses on understanding how maternal stressors during pregnancy and early life affect long-term cardiometabolic outcomes for children. He has extensive experience in epidemiological data analysis and healthcare data science in R and Stata languages. He speaks fluent Spanish and is trying to push hard to learn Portugese with Duolingo ;). In his free time, he enjoys playing guitar, doing outdoor activities, playing with his two cats, and explore virtual worlds through videogames. Darwin holds a M.D. from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, the oldest university in the American continent.\n\n\n\nPeru and Latin America\n\n\n\nRainbow Mountain\n\n\n\nDuring his medical training and early life years, Darwin was exposed to diverse underserved populations significantly affected by non-communicable diseases, many of these concurrently. Witnessing firsthand how social disparities ravaged families through limited healthcare access and poor health outcomes fueled his passion to understand the dynamics between social determinants of health and non-communicable diseases. His experiences with various populations across Peru enriched his perspective and reinforced his commitment to addressing health inequities through research.\n\n\n\nOutside academia\n\n\n\nRainbow Mountain\n\n\n\nAn avid cat lover, he cherishes spending time at home with his two Peruvian feline companions. In his free time, he enjoys playing video games and engaging in outdoor activities with his fiancée."
