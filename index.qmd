::: {style="text-align: justify; hyphens: auto;"}
Welcome to my new site!

I am a Peruvian physician-scientist, epidemiologist, data analyst, musician, gamer, and a Master in Public Health candidate at University of Washington, Seattle in the [Department of Global Health](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/). My research focus is to understand the link between adverse experiences during pregnancy, the perinatal period, and infancy, and the development of cardiometabolic diseases during youth and young adulthood.
